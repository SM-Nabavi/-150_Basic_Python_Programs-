# Program 18
Write a Python Program to Print the Fibonacci sequence.

Fibonacci sequence:<br>
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. So, the sequence begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is obtained by adding the previous two numbers. This pattern continues indefinitely, generating a sequence that looks like this:<br>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.<br>
