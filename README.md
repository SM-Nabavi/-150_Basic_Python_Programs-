# 🎯 Educational Objectives
 **This repository is suitable for:**

- 🔰 **Python beginners** to start programming

- 🎓 **Students** to practice basic concepts

- 👨‍💻 **Developers** to review the basics

- 📝 **Interview preparation** for technical questions

# Before Running Each Project
### **⚠️ Important: Read the problem statement first!**

### Before executing any program, please read its corresponding problem statement and description:

**1.Each project folder (program1/, program2/, etc.) contains a dedicated README.md file**

**2.This README includes :**

- 📝 Complete problem statement

- 🎯 Expected input/output

- 💡 Program description and logic

- 🔍 Implementation details

**3.Always follow this order :**

```
Step 1: Read programX/README.md → Understand the problem

Step 2: Run programX/main.py → Execute the solution
```

**This approach helps you :**

- Think about the problem before seeing the solution

- Better understand the programming logic

- Improve your problem-solving skills

# Project implementation
### Clone the repository :
```
git clone https://github.com/SM-Nabavi/-150_Basic_Python_Programs-.git
```

### Go to the project folder :
```
cd -150_Basic_Python_Programs-/programs
```
### First, read the problem statement :

Each program folder contains a README.md file with the complete problem description:
```
cat program1/README.md  # Read the problem first (Linux/Mac)
# or
type program1\README.md  # Read the problem first (Windows)
```
### Run a specific project (example: project 1) :
```
python program1/main.py
```
