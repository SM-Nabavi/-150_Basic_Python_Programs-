# Program 26

Write a Python Program to Display Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion.

**Fibonacci Sequence:**<br>
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, it is defined by the recurrence relation:

- F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2)

with initial conditions:

- F(0)=0
- F(1)=1

The sequence begins: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, and so on.

## Output example *main.py*
