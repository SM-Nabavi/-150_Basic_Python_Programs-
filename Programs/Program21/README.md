Write a Python Program to Find the Sum of Natural Numbers.<br>


**Natural numbers** are a set of positive integers that are used to count and order objects. They are the numbers that typically start from 1 and continue indefinitely, including all the whole numbers greater than 0. In mathematical notation, the set of natural numbers is often denoted as "N" and can be expressed as:

N = 1,2,3,4,5,...

## Output example *main.py*
```
Enter the limit: 25
The sum of natural numbers up to 25 is: 325
```
