# Program 15
Write a Python Program to Print all Prime Numbers in an Interval of 1-100



Prime Numbers:
A prime number is a whole number that cannot be evenly divided by any other number except for 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are prime numbers because they cannot be divided by any other positive integer except for 1 and their own value.
