# Program 27
**Write a Python Program to Find Factorial of Number Using Recursion.**

The factorial of a non-negative integer ( n ) is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to ( n ). It is denoted by ( n! ) and is defined as:

$$𝑛! = 𝑛 × (𝑛 − 1) × (𝑛 − 2) × … × 3 × 2 × 1$$

For example:
- 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 
- 0 is defined to be 1

Factorials are commonly used in mathematics, especially in combinatorics and probability, to count the number of ways a set of elements can be arranged or selected.
